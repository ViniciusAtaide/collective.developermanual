Introduction
============

This is the Sphinx source for the `Plone CMS <http://plone.org>`_
developer manual used on the site `developer.plone.org <http://developer.plone.org>`_.

To read the documentation (formatted) in your web browser,
please head to the `Plone Developer Documentation <http://developer.plone.org/index.html>`_.

To learn how to update and manage this documentation and its tools, read
`Writing and updating this documentation <http://developer.plone.org/reference_manuals/active/writing/writing.html>`_.

Some clarifications:

* ``source`` folder contains the Sphinx manual source

* ``src`` folder will be target for Plone source code, checkout-ed for source code documentation inclusion

* Uploading documentation to plone.org is no longer supported - instead readthedocs.org is preferred method of distribution
