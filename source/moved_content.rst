 The documentation has been moved to a new location
========================================================

.. note ::

    You have arrived at this page, because you tried to access a deep link on plone.org developer manual and this link has been moved.

*plone.org* developer documentation has moved to `Sphinx based developer documentation management system <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_, as this provides easier document management,
is aligned with other Python projects and allows us to integrate documentation from several source code packages under the same umbrella.

Unfortunately, due to the content migration to Sphinx, we no longer can redirect you to the old document, as there doesn't exist 1:1 mapping
between the old *plone.org* content and new `developer.plone.org <http://developer.plone.org>`_ content.

**Starting points to find the old documentation you are looking for**

* `Developer documentation front page <http://developer.plone.org>`_

* `Old Plone 3 developer manuals <http://developer.plone.org/#old-manuals>`_

* `Old Plone 3 theme reference <http://developer.plone.org/reference_manuals/old/plone_3_theming/index.html>`_

* `Dexterity developer manual <http://developer.plone.org/reference_manuals/external/plone.app.dexterity/index.html>`_

For any questions please send email to `plone-docs mailing list <http://plone.org/support/forums/docs>`_.
