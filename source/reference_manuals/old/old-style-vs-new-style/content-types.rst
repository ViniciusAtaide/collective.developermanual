Content types
=============

Plone is a content management system (CMS) built on top of the Zope Content
Management Framework (CMF).

As such, one of the core features is the ability to add various types of
content objects, such as:

* Folder
* Page
* Image
* File

Early implementations of content types in Plone were built exclusively with
the Zope CMF. Since then, two other significant
frameworks have come along to advance the state of the art: **Archetypes** and
**Dexterity**.

This document aims to provide "top level" perspective for those not familiar
with Plone technology. And what follows is a description of each technology
along with information about the version of Plone it works with.

CMF
---

Used to build the orginal content types from Plone 0.1 to 2.0.

Archetypes
----------

Used to build the content types from versions 2.1 to present (4.1 at the time
of this writing).

Dexterity
---------

Came along around the time of Plone 3 as an alternative to Archetypes. Will
likely replace AT as the default content type technology in a future release
of Plone (hard to say when, but if "Plone 6" means anything to you, then that is
when it *might* happen.)
