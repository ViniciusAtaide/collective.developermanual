What's a Plone Theme?
=====================

A brief description of what we're talking about.

A theme is a collection of page templates, style sheets, components, and
configuration settings that go to make up the individual look and feel
of a Plone site.

Plone gives you the option of embedding your theme changes and additions
into a single site by working through the web. Or, alternatively, by
packaging your theme into your own product, you can then install and
uninstall it at will and apply it to a number of sites. There are pros
and cons to both approaches, and this manual runs through them in later
sections.

Plone 3 comes with with two themes:

-  an inbuilt, ready-made theme - Plone Default
-  and an additional optional replacement - NuPlone. 

Things are somewhat different in Plone 4:

-  Two themes are available -  Plone Classic and Sunburst (with Sunburst
   being the active theme when you first install Plone)
-  Plone Default still exists as the core on which both Plone Classic
   and Sunburst are built and should prove a useful basis for any theme
   product
-  NuPlone has been removed but is still available for download if
   required

If you're at all skeptical about what can be achieved, have a look at
the wealth of different sites showcased on
`plone.net <http://plone.net/>`_ or at the downloadable themes available
from the `Products section <http://plone.org/documentation/products>`_
of this site.

If you already have a Plone 3 theme and want to know how to upgrade it
to work with Plone 4 then the `upgrade
guide <http://plone.org/documentation/manual/upgrade-guide>`_ has
further information and guidance.
