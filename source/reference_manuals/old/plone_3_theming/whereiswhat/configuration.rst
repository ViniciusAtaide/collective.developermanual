Files for Configuration
=======================

These files and directories will be relevant when working on the
Configuration part of your theme.

/profiles/default/

This directory holds the xml for Generic Setup. The plone3\_theme paster
template will have provided you with some ready-made files - for setting
up your skin layers, registering your style sheets and JavaScripts, and
ordering your viewlets.

/profiles.zcml

When your Zope instance starts up, this file makes the profile available
for Generic Setup to use.
