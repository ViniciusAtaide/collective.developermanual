Firefox/mozilla UI development tools
====================================

Firefox and mozilla have a number of extensions that can greatly help
your UI development work. A basic set is listed here.

Using trusty old "view source" used to be the way to debug bad-looking
html. Now there are mozilla/firefox extensions that make html
development much more productive. A basic set is listed here to get you
up to speed.

Web developer
    `Web
    developer <http://chrispederick.com/work/firefox/webdeveloper/>`_
    adds a web development toolbar to your firefox with almost
    everything you'd want to do or know. CSS info, validation, resizing
    to test other screen resolutions, converting POSTs to GETs. **An
    essential**.
Aardvark
    `Aardvark <http://www.karmatics.com/aardvark/>`_, when enabled for a
    page, shows you the class/id information when you hover over an
    element. Pressing ``v`` for instance, gives you the source for the
    item you hover over. Start the demo on their site and experiment
    with the keystrokes. It is a lightweight and elegant tool.
ColorZilla
    `ColorZilla <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/271/>`_ is
    surprisingly handy. It does what the name suggest: providing a color
    picker that displays the hex code of the pixel you hover over in the
    status bar. There's more: showing the box size of the current box
    element; showing the element, class and ID of the current element;
    distance between two points. All in the status bar.
FireBug
    `FireBug <http://getfirebug.com/>`_ constantly displays the number
    of errors it finds in your page. Handy during development for
    finding that mis-spelled css class or the faulty javascript
    statement. Also includes some css and source examination, but
    aardvark tends to be a bit handier for that.
X-ray
    The `x-ray firefox
    extension <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1802?id=1802>`_
    is pretty handy in figuring out the layout of a plone site. It
    displays the tags, the IDs and the classes inline, giving you a
    surprisingly good idea of what's happening behind the scenes.
View formatted source
    `View formatted
    source <https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=697>`_
    gives you a well-rendered view of the page's source. More important,
    when you hover over an opening tag, it shows you the css that gets
    used for that tag. And with multiple css files (plone anyone?) it
    shows them in the order in which they're used (and overwritten).
View source with
    `View source with <https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/394>`_ allows
    you to right-click on every textarea or source view and select a
    program to edit/view it with. A bit like ExternalEditor, but then
    for **every** textarea. Not 100% developer oriented, but handy for
    small changes to test css files in the custom skin folder and so
    anyway.

Another type of useful gadgets are **bookmarklets**.
----------------------------------------------------

Two sources of these are http://squarefree.com and
http://slayeroffice.com See for example:

Web development bookmarklets
    The `Web development
    bookmarklets <http://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.html>`_
    provide the same kind of functionality as the web developer toolbar.
    The `JavaScript Shell <http://www.squarefree.com/shell/>`_ and
    `JavaScript Development
    Environment <http://www.squarefree.com/jsenv/>`_ deserve mention.
Mouse-over DOM Inspector
    The `Mouseover DOM
    Inspector <http://slayeroffice.com/tools/modi/v2.0/modi_help.html>`_
    , or MODI for short, is a favelet (also known as a bookmarklet) that
    allows you to view and manipulate the DOM of a web page simply by
    mousing around the document.
Javascript Object Tree Favelet
    The `Javascript Object Tree
    Favelet <http://slayeroffice.com/?c=/content/tools/js_tree.html>`_
    will overlay your current document with a DIV element containing a
    collapsed list of all the javascript object types currently
    referenced by the page, from functions to strings to booleans and
    all else that falls between.
Favelet Suite
    This is a `favelet that combines most of [the slayeroffice]
    development
    favelets <http://slayeroffice.com/?c=/content/tools/suite.html>`_ .
    When invoked, a div element will appear in the top left corner of
    your browser window with a list of all the favelets I've included.
    Simply click the link you want to invoke the favelet.
