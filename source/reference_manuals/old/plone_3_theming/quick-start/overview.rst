Overview
========

Once you have your new shiny Plone site installed and running, the first
thing we recommend you do is try out a few through the web
customizations - changing the font colours and replacing the Plone logo
with your own.

You probably have greater ambitions than this for the look and feel of
your site, but editing the CSS and replacing the logo is a good way of
making a start in learning theming techniques.

Prerequisites
-------------

We're assuming that you are familiar with HTML and CSS - although the
very basic customizations outlined here, don't require much knowledge of
that. It will help if, as a manager, you've had a chance to investigate
the Site Setup section of Plone.

Outline
-------

First Sharpen Your Pencils
    There are a number of tools out there that will make the process of
    theming Plone a great deal easier, :doc:`so we run through them
    here <firefox-mozilla-ui-development-tools>`.
    To see your customizations, you'll also need to be sure that you are
    running your site in :doc:`debug/development
    mode </getstarted/debug_mode>`. 
Next Try Som se CSS Customizations
    We'll walk you through the :doc:`process of overriding the page title
    style <change-the-font-colours>`,
    by customizing and editing the ploneCustom.css style sheet. All of
    this is done through-the-web via the Zope Management Interface.
Finally Replace the Logo
    We'll revisit the techniques of customization and CSS editing and
    expand on them to :doc:`replace the Plone
    logo <change-the-logo>`.
