Some final notes about customizing Archetypes view templates

So, now you should know all of the following information:

-  How to identify which parts of an Archetypes view template are
   generated by the ``header``,\ ``body``,\ ``folderlisting``, and
   ``footer`` macros
-  How to create a custom view template that overrides one or more of
   the ``header``,\ ``body``,\ ``folderlisting``, and ``footer`` macros
-  How to create a custom widget template that works in the Archetypes
   framework
-  How to create a custom ``body`` template that uses Archetypes' widget
   rendering templates
-  How to inject custom CSS code and links to custom CSS files into your
   view template

Some Final Notes
----------------

I want to cover a few details about how to apply all of these tools.
Some wise guy somewhere said something like, "To a man whose only tool
is a hammer, every problem tends to look like a nail." Your success with
Archetypes is very contingent upon selecting the appropriate tool for
your specific problem. So, use the following outline of the basic AT
page layout as a guideline to determine what should be customized:

-  ``header`` macro

   -  Title (or id if no title is present)
   -  Document actions (e.g. print, send to)

-  ``body`` macro

   -  List of fields

      -  Field label (from the ``label`` macro in the view template, if
         one exists)
      -  Field value (from the widget template's ``view`` macro)

-  ``folderlisting`` macro

   -  List of links to each sub-object

-  ``footer`` macro

   -  byline

So, based on which parts of this standard layout you need to customize,
use the appropriate macro. Keep the infamous "Foo" template around to
help you with debugging. See the next page for a reference on
customizing Archetypes view templates.
