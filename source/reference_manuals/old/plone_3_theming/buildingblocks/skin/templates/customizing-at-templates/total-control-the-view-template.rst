Total Control: The View Template
================================

This page describes how you can control every portion of the HTML output
in the content area by creating a custom view template.

Okay, so you've hacked up some custom widget templates, and they're
basking in the glory of your newfound power, yet you're still not
satisfied. You want to control it **all**! Well, *I've* got the
information for *you*!

Archetypes and Type-Specific View Templates
-------------------------------------------

Archetypes automatically recognizes templates with specific names, and
uses the code within those templates to display your AT-based object.
All of this magic happens within the ``base_view`` template. To create a
custom view template, convert your type name to lowercase (the name
that's listed in ``portal_types``, or what's returned from
``myObject.portal_type``). Now, replace spaces with underscores ( \_ ).
Finally, add ``_view`` to the end of the name, and you've *almost* got a
custom view template.

See below for examples of type names and their corresponding view
templates.

Type Name

View Template Name

My Type

``my_type_view``

SomeTypeV2

``sometypev2_view``

Now, to remedy that "almost" part of the above paragraph, define one or
more of the following macros in your template:

-  ``header``
-  ``body``
-  ``folderlisting``
-  ``footer``

Voila! You've got a custom view template. To see how this works, create
a simple template (named appropriately, of course) that contains the
following code:

::

              Foo

              Foo

              Foo

              Foo

And, just like magic, you should see, rendered in your content area:

   :align: center
   :alt: The Infamous "Foo" View

   The Infamous "Foo" View
But Wait! Where Are All My Fields?
----------------------------------

So now you want your data back. You said you wanted total control, and
now you don't want total control. But the point of this tutorial isn't
control, it's *shine*. So, let's explore how to mix and match existing
AT templates with your custom code to make a shiny template that renders
exactly how *you* want it.

First, keep the above "Foo" template around. It's very useful when you
aren't quite sure which of the four macros is generating a portion of
the content area. Simply comment out one or more of the macros, and
you'll see which macro generates what portion.

Now, do you remember when I talked about using the ``base`` template as
a starting point for creating custom templates? Well, that's what we'll
do. Let's start by customizing the footer. The ``footer`` macro in the
following template is copied directly from 'base':

::

    Get the byline - contains details about author and modification date.

Now, let's add something below the byline, say, some important
information that applies to every instance of your custom type::

::

    Get the byline - contains details about author and modification date.
    Important information that applies to every instance of my custom type.

Notice that all we had to do was copy the macro from ``base`` , and add
the `` <p>`` tag with some text in it. Notice that, for example, we
could have used ``tal:content="here/getCustomFooterData"`` in the
``</p> <p>`` tag if we had defined a ``getCustomFooterData()`` method in
our class.

Now, let's apply this concept to the ``body`` macro, and play around
with displaying fields. First, we'll start by coping the ``body`` from
``base`` into our template.

Now, we'll change up some things by adding a little bit of code into the
macro. First, notice that the ``tal:repeat`` is repeating over all the
fields that are not metadata. Therefore, if you want to do something for
every field, put it inside this macro. You could (conceivably) rearrange
the macro so that the ``tal:repeat`` loop is inside another containing
block, and put TAL code before and after the display of the fields, or
make use of the ``first`` and ``last`` ``repeat`` variables to achieve
the same thing. So, let's do two things to customize our ``body`` macro:

-  Surround all the fields with a ``</p> <div>`` that has a custom CSS
   class, ``my-custom-at-body``
-  Surround each field with a `` <div>`` that has a different custom CSS
   class, ``my-custom-at-field``

These changes, as I'm sure you've figured out, aren't going to make much
of a difference (if any) in the look of the rendered page without
actually writing some custom CSS code. We now introduce the ``css``
macro:

::

    <link href="#" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <div class="my-custom-at-body">
    <div class="my-custom-at-field">&nbsp;</div>
    </div>

Now, we can define a CSS stylesheet called ``my_custom_css.css`` that
contains our custom CSS code:

::

        .my-custom-at-body {
            border: thin dashed;
            background-color: #cccccc;
            padding-top: 1em;
        }

        .my-custom-at-field {
            background-color: #ffffff;
        }

Archetypes inserts the ``css`` macro into the '' tag of the rendered
page, making our custom CSS code, linked files, and includes available
within the page. Our end-result would look something like this:

   :align: center
   :alt: Custom Body Macro

   Custom Body Macro
If we had created custom widget templates, those would be applied to the
rendered page as well.

Customizing Labels
------------------

There's still one element of control that we're missing: we still can't
override the display of a field label. By customizing the display of the
label, we can insert images, links, etc. into the page instead of the
default label.

The macro included in our custom view template below will do that magic
for us:

::

    <link href="#" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <div class="my-custom-at-body">
    <div class="my-custom-at-field">&nbsp;</div>
    </div>
    <label>Now presenting... Field1!</label>

Notice that I've only overridden the default label for fields labeled
"myfield". The ``label`` macro in ``widgets/field`` is where the default
behavior can be found. The final result looks like this:

.. figure:: http://plone.org/documentation/manual/theme-reference/buildingblocks/skin/templates/customizing-at-templates/customlabel.jpg/image_preview
   :align: center
   :alt: Customized Label

   Customized Label
Also, don't forget that you have the power to omit
``head``,\ ``body``,\ ``folderlisting``, and ``footer`` by simply
writing in do-nothing macros into your view template. Furthermore, you
can reach into your object and retrieve field values without using the
widget framework.
