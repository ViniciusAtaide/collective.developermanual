So, how severely you limit connections per client should depend on your balance of page to blob serves."

If you come across a piece of Grok documentation, chances are you can get it to work in Zope 2 by switching the \"*import grok*\" line to \"*from five import grok*\", although there are situations where this is not the case. In particular, we tend to use Plone content types instead of Grok ”models\" and standard add/edit forms instead of the formlib-based forms from Grok."

msgid "At the most basic level, a view is a component (in fact, a named multi-adapter) that is looked up during traversal (i.e. when Zope interpreters a URL) and then called by the Zope publisher to obtain a string of HTML to return to the browser. That normally involves a page template, although it is possible to construct the response in code as well. Sometimes, the view may not return anything. One reason may be that it results in a redirect. Furthermore, some views are not designed to be invoked from URL traversal, instead containing utility methods which are looked up from other views or components."

In this manual, we are actually using some intermediary base classes from *plone.directives.form*, which serve two purposes: they allow the forms to be “grokked”, for example to associate a page template or register the form as a view using directives like *grok.context()* and *grok.name()*; some of them also provide a hook for *schema forms*, which use form hints supplied in directives (like *form.widget()* as we saw in the previous section) that are interpreted by *plone.autoform* to configure the form’s fields. Whilst we can do everything in code using the plain *z3c.form* API, many people may prefer the more declarative style of configuration that comes with *plone.autoform* and *plone.directives.form*, because it involves less code and keeps the field-specific form configuration closer to the field definitions."

If you’re working with references, parent objects, or a small number of child objects, it is usually OK to load objects directly to work with them. However, if you are working with a large or unknown-but-potentially-large number of objects, you should consider using catalog searches to find them and use catalog metadata to store frequently used values. There is an important trade-off to be made between limiting object access and bloating the catalog with unneeded indexes and metadata, though.

Take a look at the `plone.autoform`_ documentation to learn more about the various hints that are possible. The most common ones are ``form.fieldset()``, to define groups of fields, ``form.widget()``, to set a widget for a particular field, and ``form.omit()`` to hide one or more fields from the form.

msgid "Mock testing is a somewhat controversial topic. On the one hand, it allows you to write tests for things that are often difficult to test, and a mock framework can - once you are familiar with it - make child’s play out of the often laborious task of creating reliable test doubles. On the other hand, mock based tests are inevitably tied to the implementation of the code under test, and sometimes this coupling can be too tight for the test to be meaningful. Using mock objects normally also means that you need a very good understanding of the external APIs you are mocking. Otherwise, your mock may not be a good representation of how these systems would behave in the real world. Much has been written on this, for example by `Martin Fowler`_."

msgid "As always, it pays to be pragmatic. If you find that you can’t write a mock based test without reading every line of code in the method under test and reverse engineering it for the mocks, then an integration test may be more appropriate. In fact, it is prudent to have at least some integration tests in any case, since you can never be 100% sure your mocks are valid representations of the real objects they are mocking."

The links are typically to a Content Type function (that returns a page), or to a page template (I only know how to make .pt and .cpt types so far). The actions for the Content Type are defined (overriden) using the Factory Type Information format, and the process well described in the Archetype tutorials. I'll just add that you can make most of the tabs (actions) visible=True or visible=False. You can append your own actions that show up as tabs for your content type."

The techniques of RichDocument, in particular relating to extending ATContentTypes, are still valid in Plone 2.5. What Plone 2.5 allows us to do, however, is to achieve better separation of concerns between content storage, business logic and view logic, due to the added spices of Zope 3.

Again, changing the logic of who gets an email notification or how a particular list of open issues is calculated may involve subclassing one or all of Poi's content types, re-registering view templates and other content type information, and possibly customise a number of templates and scripts to reference the new subclassed types.

This is all rather Archetypes-specific, and in Zope 3 schemas, we typically prefer simple properties (a *name* attribute) to pairs of methods.

In the olden days, we would probably have put methods like *getAvailableProjectAddableTypes()*into the *Project* content type. Hopefully, you'll see why this is less optimal than having it in a separate component (hint: what if you in your customisation of b-org wanted to be much more particular about which types were addable?). You will hopefully start to pick up \"fat\" interfaces during interface design - if you had a neat *IProject* interface that described attributes of a project that were to be saved alongside the project object, and then found a couple of methods about defining addable types that were related to one another but not so much to the data of a project in general, you would hopefully reach for a new interface.

Each of these contains tests that verify the given type is available and can be instantiated and edited. This catches errors in Archetypes registrations or schemas. There are then further tests for the *membrane*integration and for the adapters to the canonical interfaces *IDepartment*, *IEmployee* and *IProject*. Lastly, non-trivial methods in content types and relevant adapters are given their own test fixtures. By being systematic and diligent with tests, many, many bugs were caught and dealt with before they ever hit a live system. Of course, this does not replace in-browser acceptance testing, which was also performed regularly.

We restrict this to objects inside the Department object. The net effect is that all Employee objects inside the Department are returned. Now, let's say you had a need for a Department which in addition to acting as a group for all members inside it, also allowed some members from other departments to be in that group. In this case, you could use a schema extender to add a *ReferenceField* to the schema of Department that allowed the Department owner to reference other Employees.

This is good practice, because PAS plug-ins can be managed via *acl\\_users* in the ZMI. If you find yourself wandering there, however, remember to bring a torch and keep a trail of breadcrumbs to find your way out. A backup wouldn't hurt either if you try to change things. It is, unfortunately, not the most intuitive of interfaces. We will see how the plug-in is registered and activated in a moment, but first notice that the plug-in implements an interface, *ILocalRolesPlugin*,Â  which is defined by PlonePAS, the PAS-in-Plone integration layer. This defines methods that will be called by the PAS machinery to determine, in this case, local roles. Note that this is *not* an adapter (perhaps it would have been if PAS had been invented in Zope 3, though Zope 3 has its own authentication machinery that is evolved from PAS and works slightly differently). When created, the *ProjectLocalRoleManager* is an Zope 2 object that lives in the ZODB in *acl\\_users*. The methods of the *ILocalRolesPlugin* interface are fairly self-explanatory in purpose. They allow PAS to extract the local roles for a particular user in a particular context (*getRolesInContext()*), to check whether a user in fact has one of the roles required to access a particular method attribute in a particular context (*checkLocalRolesAllowed()*), and to get a map of users-to-roles in a particular context. The complex parts are, as often is the case, concerned with acquistion. The helper method *\\_findWorkspace()* attempts to walk up the object hierarchy to find the first possible *IWorkspace* (it will only consider one) to get hold of the appropriate *IWorkspace* adapter that is then used to determine the actual roles that apply, as above. Without walking up the content hierarchy, it would not be possible to let the local roles of a particular project apply when in the context of a piece of content *inside* that project (i.e. a sub-object of the folderish *Project* object). There is some reasonably hairy acqusition-juggling going on in the \\_*chain()* method to return this chain as a generator. The hairiness comes from the fact that the thing that is being checked may in fact be a method that is being accessed, and aqusition chains can get themselves in all kinds of knots, especially when Five is in the mix. Lastly, we need to declare a *ClassSecurityInfo* and call *InitializeClass* to get Zope 2 to play ball."

There are two interfaces in ``CMFDynamicViewFTI.interfaces`` that are used to support this functionality: IBrowserDefault – Provides information about the layout current selection of a given content object, including any selected deafult-page ISelectableBrowserDefault – Extends IBrowserDeafult with methods to manipulate the current selection The canonical implementation of both these interfaces is in ``CMFDynamicViewFTI.browserdefault.BrowserDefaultMixin``. This in turn gets the vocabulary of available view methods from the FTI (and hence this can be edited through-the-web in ``portal\\_types``), and stores the current selection in two properties on each content object: ``layout``, for the currently selected view template, and ``default\\_page`` if any default page is selected. If both are set, the default-page will take precedence. ``BrowserDefaultMixin`` actually provides a ``\\_\\_call\\_\\_`` method which means that will render the object with its default layout template. However, ``PloneTool.browserDefault()`` will actually query the interface directly to find out which template to display - please see the next page for the gory details."

This functionality is defined in a pair of interfaces in ``CMFPlone.interfaces.constrains``, ``IConstrainTypes`` for read-only access and ``ISelectableConstrainTypes`` for the mutators. The canonical implementation of these interfaces is in ``ATContentTypes.lib.constraintypes``. This provides storage for the constraint mode (more below) and the list of locally allowed and “preferred” types. The preferred types are the ones that appear in the list immediately, and the rest of the allowed types appear behind a “more…” item. The constraint type mode can be ``ACQUIRE`` (the default), ``DISABLED`` or ``ENABLED``. When disabled, the settings in ``portal\\_types`` are used. When enabled, the list of types explicitly set are used. When set to acquire, the parent folder`s types will be used \\*if\\* the parent is of the same portal type as the folder in question. If they are of different types the settings in ``portal\\_types`` apply.

This means that you can go to /path/to/file/view and get the view of the file, even if /path/to/file would dump the content (since it has an index\\_html() method that does that). This mechanism uses the method view(), defined in PortalContent in CMF (and also in BaseFolder in Archetypes). view() returns 'self()', which results in a call to \\_\\_call\\_\\_().

This level of indirection is actually quite useful. First of all, we get a standard set of URLs, so /path/to/object/edit is always edit, /path/to/object/view is always view. The actions (tabs) can point to these, meaning that we can pretty much use the same set of actions for all common types, with the variation happening in the aliases instead. Secondly, a method alias with the name \"(Default)\" specifies what happens when you browse to the object without any template or action specified. That is, /path/to/object will look up the \"(Default)\" alias. This may specify a page template, for example, or a method (such as a file-dumping index\\_html()) to call. Crucially, if \"(Default)\" is not set or is an empty string, CMF falls back on the old behaviour of calling the \\_\\_browser\\_default\\_\\_() method. In PloneFolder.py, this is defined to call PloneTool.browserDefault(), as mentioned above, which implements the Plone-specific rules for the lookup.

The exceptions are File and Image, which have the \"(Default)\" alias pointing to \"index\\_html\", and the \"view\" alias pointing to \"(selected layout)\". This way, /path/to/file results in the file content (via the index\\_html() method) and /path/to/file/view shows the selected layout inside Plone. (Note that using \"(dynamic view)\" for the \"view\" alias would \\*not\\* work, because the index\\_html attribute would take precedence over the layout when testing for a default-page.) Additionaly, the 'view' action (tab) for each of these types must be 'string:${object\\_url}/view' to ensure it invokes the \"view\" alias, not the \"(Default)\" alias. For Folders, the use of \"(dynamic view)\" takes care of the default-page and the selected view template. The 'folderlisting' fallback is no longer needed - the 'view' action can still be \"string:${object\\_url}\", and the \"(Default)\" alias pointing to \"(dynamic view)\" takes care of the rest. In order for the \"(dynamic view)\" target to work as expected, it needs to delegate to PloneTool so that Plone's rules for lookup order and (especially) ITranslatable/LinguaPlone support are used. However, delegating to PloneTool.browserDefault() is not an option, because this does other checks which are not relevant (this essentially stems from the fact that browserDefault() is implementing \\*both\\* the \"(Default)\" and \"view\" cases above in a single method). Thus, the code for determining which, if any, contained content object should be used as a default-page has been factored out to its own method, PloneTool.getDefaultPage(). Helpfully, this can also be used by PloneTool.isDefaultPage(), radically simplifying that method."

msgid "The last issue is what happens with view() and \\_\\_call\\_\\_() in this equation. The first thing to note is that view() method is masked by the 'view' method alias. Hence, /path/to/object/view will invoke the method alias 'view' if it exists, not call view(), making that method a lot less relevant. However, we still want \\_\\_call\\_\\_() to have a well-defined behaviour. In CMF 1.4, \\_\\_call\\_\\_()used to look up the 'view' action, and this is still the default fallback, but if the \"(Default)\" alias is set, this is used instead. This may give somewhat unexpected behaviour, however: From the comments in the source code and the behaviour in Zope, where \\_\\_call\\_\\_() is the last fallback if neither \\_\\_browser\\_default\\_\\_() nor index\\_html are found, and to ensure that the \"view() --> \\_\\_call\\_\\_()\" mechanism always returns the object itself, never dumped file content, it seems to be the intention that \\_\\_call\\_\\_() should always return the object, never a default-page or file content dumped via an index\\_html() method. For \\*Folders\\* in Plone 2.0, this was actually not the case: \\_\\_call\\_\\_() would look up the 'view' action, which was \"string:${object\\_url}\", which with the use of \\_\\_browser\\_default\\_\\_() resulted in a lookup of a default-page if one was present. With the CMF 1.5 behaviour, the use of the \"(Default)\" alias in \\_\\_call\\_\\_() will mean that calling a File returns the dumped file content. Calling a Folder will return the default-page (or the Folder in its view if no default page is set) as in Plone 2.0. The behaviour in Plone 2.1 is that \\_\\_call\\_\\_(), as overridden in BrowserDefaultMixin, should always return the object itself as it would be rendered in Plone without any index\\_html or default-page magic. Hence, \\_\\_call\\_\\_() in CMFDynamicViewFTI looks up the \"(selected layout)\" target and resolves this. This behaviour is thus consistent with the old behaviour of Documents and Files, but whereas Folders with a default-page in 2.0 used to return that default page from \\_\\_call\\_\\_(), in 2.1, it returns the Folder itself rendered in its selected layout. Again remember that this method will rarely if ever be called, since /path/to/object is intercepted by CMF's pre-traversal hook and ends up looking up the \"(Default)\" method alias (which \\*does\\* honour default-page for Folders), and /path/to/object/view uses the \"view\" method alias, as described above."

Always fix up your test (and run it!) afterwards, to make sure that the test remains valid for the future - otherwise, you will end up clicking around the UI in anger again before you know it."
