Typically, it will only appear via link and script elements in the head of the document (or at its very end when that improved rendering). In particular, HTML tags should nearly never have event-handler (e.g., onclick or onsubmit) tag attributes or JavaScript in URLs. Coding JavaScript into HTML tags generally makes for code that is hard to maintain and nearly impossible to test."
