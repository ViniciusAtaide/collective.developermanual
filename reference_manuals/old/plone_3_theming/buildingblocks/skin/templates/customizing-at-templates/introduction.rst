Goals, Pre-Requisites, and Tools

So you think Archetypes' way of automagically generating HTML to view
your object isn't pretty enough? Well, you've come to the right place!
I'm going to teach you how to dress up those boring, drab views and make
them *shine*!

Goals: What will I learn?
-------------------------

-  How Archetypes generates views for content objects
-  How much control Archetypes gives you
-  How to change the HTML output for a particular field by creating a
   custom widget template
-  How to use the Archetypes template framework to make minor changes to
   the default AT-generated view
-  How to customize the HTML output for the entire view of an Archetypes
   object by using the ``title``,\ ``body``,\ ``folderlisting``, and
   ``footer`` macros

Pre-Requisites: What do I need to know?
---------------------------------------

-  How to read and write Python code
