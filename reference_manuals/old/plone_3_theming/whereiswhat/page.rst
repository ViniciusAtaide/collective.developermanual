Where is What on the Page
=========================

How can you track down the files related to an individual page element?

At the time of writing, there's no in-built magic wand to point at an
element on a Plone web page and find out exactly what templates and code
are involved in its creation. There may be soon though, and the
adventurous might like to explore `Weblion's Gloworm
tool <http://weblion.psu.edu/blog/esteele/gloworm-0-1-alpha1-now-available>`_.

If you're not ready for an adventure yet, then there are a number of
good tutorials available with diagrams and guides to where is what.

Understanding how the CSS maps to the Page
------------------------------------------

The Weblion project has an excellent Wiki page to help you with this

 

-  `https://weblion.psu.edu/trac/weblion/wiki/PloneThreeWhereIsWhat <https://weblion.psu.edu/trac/weblion/wiki/PloneThreeWhereIsWhat>`_

 

Firebug (an add-on for Firefox), of course, is an essential tool for
inspecting code and CSS for a page.

Page Elements
-------------

Page elements are consistently named in Plone, so once you know the name
of an area of the page, you're well on the way to tracking down the
relevant files

-  you can find a visual key to page elements in the Elements section of
   this manual
-  you'll also find an excellent overview in the `What Controls What You
   See <http://plone.org/documentation/tutorial/where-is-what/introduction>`_\ tutorial
   on Plone.org
-  and a mapping of the viewlet and portlet managers on the `Weblion
   wiki <https://weblion.psu.edu/trac/weblion/wiki/PloneThreeWhereIsWhat>`_
