 Old documentation

.. admonition:: Description

    How Plone documentation team deals with old documentation.

Ancient documentation
=======================

Plone Developer Manual has a special section *Old reference manuals*
for documentation which is no longer under active maintenance.

This includes

* Old content from plone.org which has been migrated to Sphinx format

* Content from Plone Developer Documentation where the documentation
  team feels it no longer reflects the modern Plone versions
  and best practices

The old documentation is moved to *reference_manual/old* section
and will receive a special warning label to tell the readers
that the information may no longer be totally coherent.

Reactivation
==============

The documentation can be moved to Reference Manual's *active*
section if some developer volunteers to update it to reflect best practices.
